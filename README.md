OrbitPage is a public-page builder with a real editing workspace, not only a list of buttons. It supports links, rich content blocks, media, social profiles, maps, events, contact information, themes, analytics, SEO controls, consent settings, and responsive public rendering.

This repository contains the **open-source, self-hosted edition**. It runs as one Node.js application with a React admin interface, an Express API, SQLite persistence, and local file storage. No external database is required.

## Choose Your Edition

OrbitPage is available in two forms built around the same page builder and public-page experience.

| | Open-source edition | Managed SaaS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Best for | Self-hosters, homelabs, developers, and teams that want infrastructure control | People and businesses that want OrbitPage without operating a server |
| Where it runs | Your Docker host, VM, or Node.js platform | Managed at [orbitpage.com](https://orbitpage.com) |
| Source | This public repository, MIT licensed | Hosted platform and managed control plane |
| Data | SQLite database and uploads on your persistent volume | Managed accounts, storage, publishing, and backups |
| Public URL | Your own deployment URL | Hosted username URL, with custom domains on eligible plans |
| Newsletters | Not included; connect an external newsletter tool if needed | Tenant SMTP, double opt-in subscribers, scheduled campaigns, and delivery reports on eligible paid plans |
| Operations | You handle deployment, TLS, updates, backups, and availability | OrbitPage handles the hosting workflow |
| Cost | Software is free; you pay for your infrastructure | Free and paid plans are listed on the [pricing page](https://orbitpage.com/pricing) |

The managed control plane, billing system, and hosting infrastructure are not included in this repository. Improvements to the shared OrbitPage application can be released in both editions.

Managed newsletters are also a hosted-platform feature rather than part of this repository. Eligible paid workspaces can connect their own SMTP server, collect confirmed subscribers, create and schedule branded campaigns, and review SMTP acceptance, opens, clicks, rejections, and unsubscribes. The customer remains responsible for consent, sender-domain authentication, provider charges, and mailing-list compliance. See the [managed service](https://orbitpage.com/hosting) and [pricing](https://orbitpage.com/pricing) for current availability and limits.

## How It Works

The self-hosted edition is intentionally compact:

```text
Browser
  ├─ Public OrbitPage
  └─ /dashboard/profile React workspace
           │
           ▼
      Express API
       ├─ SQLite database
       └─ Local uploads
```

Repository layout:

```text
app/
  src/          React + TypeScript frontend
  server/       Express API, authentication, SQLite, and uploads
  public/       Static and brand assets
docs/
  wiki/         Installation and operations guides
.github/        CI, release, and container workflows
Dockerfile      Production multi-stage image
docker-compose.yml
```

## Quick Start With Docker

Docker is the recommended production path.

### One-command Linux install

On a clean x86-64 Debian 12/13 or Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 server, VM, or LXC, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paoloronco/OrbitPage/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The installer uses Docker's official apt repository, creates a persistent data directory, generates a private JWT secret, starts OrbitPage, and waits for its health check. It is idempotent: running it again preserves the existing secret and data.

Do not run this guest installer directly on a Proxmox VE host. Use the dedicated host installer below instead.

### One-command Proxmox VE install

On an x86-64 Proxmox VE 8 or newer host, run as `root`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paoloronco/OrbitPage/main/install-pve.sh | bash
```

It downloads the latest Debian 12 template when needed, creates an unprivileged LXC with Docker-compatible `nesting` and `keyctl`, enables DHCP and the Proxmox firewall on `vmbr0`, installs OrbitPage inside the guest, and prints the public and first-setup URLs. Docker is never installed on the PVE host.

Defaults are 2 cores, 2 GB RAM, 12 GB disk, CT ID from the cluster, and port `8080`. Every value can be overridden without editing the script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paoloronco/OrbitPage/main/install-pve.sh | \
  ORBITPAGE_PVE_CTID=250 \
  ORBITPAGE_PVE_HOSTNAME=orbitpage \
  ORBITPAGE_PVE_BRIDGE=vmbr0 \
  ORBITPAGE_PVE_MEMORY=4096 \
  bash
```

After installation:

```bash
orbitpage status
orbitpage logs
orbitpage update
orbitpage backup
```

See [Deployment](./docs/wiki/Deployment.md) for Linux and Proxmox options, static networking, image pinning, backups, updates, and removal.

### Docker run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name orbitpage \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -v orbitpage_data:/app/data \
  paueron/orbitpage:latest
```

Open:

- Public page: <http://localhost:8080>
- Admin workspace: <http://localhost:8080/dashboard/profile>
- Health check: <http://localhost:8080/health>

Before setup, the public URL shows a deliberate **Under construction** welcome screen with links to this repository and the managed OrbitPage service. Open `/dashboard/profile` to start the installation wizard. OrbitPage checks the Node.js runtime, SQLite schema, persistent storage, frontend build, and session-secret configuration before it accepts any credentials.

The first username is always `admin` and cannot be changed. Choose its password and the primary public-page slug in the wizard. OrbitPage creates the administrator, page address, and starter profile together; it then opens the real dashboard and offers the guided product tutorial. Each workspace area has a stable URL, such as `/dashboard/links` and `/dashboard/theme`; the legacy `/admin` URL redirects to the profile section.

The Docker image is published to both registries:

```text
paueron/orbitpage:latest
ghcr.io/paoloronco/orbitpage:latest
```

Versioned image tags are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paoloronco/OrbitPage/releases).

## Docker Compose

1. Review [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml).
2. Replace the sample `JWT_SECRET` with a long random value.
3. Start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The included Compose file stores persistent data in `./orbitpage-data`. Keep this directory when recreating or upgrading the container.

## Run From Source

Requirements:

- Node.js `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`
- npm
- Git

Install and start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paoloronco/OrbitPage.git
cd OrbitPage/app
npm ci
npm run install:server
export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export DATA_DIR="$PWD/.orbitpage-data"
npm run start
```

On Windows PowerShell, set the same stable values before `npm run start`:

```powershell
$env:JWT_SECRET = [Convert]::ToHexString([Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::GetBytes(32)).ToLower()
$env:DATA_DIR = "$PWD\.orbitpage-data"
npm run start
```

The production-style source installation runs on <http://localhost:3001> by default.

## First-Run Flow

The same onboarding is used by Docker, the one-command installer, and source installations:

1. Open the public URL to confirm that OrbitPage is running. A fresh instance displays **Under construction** and is automatically excluded from indexing and analytics.
2. Open `/dashboard/profile`.
3. Review the live dependency checks. Failed checks block setup and include a short corrective message.
4. Keep the fixed `admin` username and create a strong password.
5. Choose the primary page slug, for example `my-brand` for `/my-brand`.
6. Complete setup. The administrator, slug, and empty starter profile are committed atomically, then the dashboard tutorial starts.

The public URL, canonical metadata, sitemap, QR tools, and dashboard **Public page** action use the chosen slug. Existing installations created before this flow remain backward compatible and continue serving their main page at `/` until a slug exists.

## Configuration

The essential server configuration is deliberately small.

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Production | Random at runtime | Signs admin sessions. Use a stable, long random value in production. |
| `PORT` | No | `3001` (`8080` in Docker) | HTTP listening port. |
| `DATA_DIR` | Recommended | Server directory (`/app/data` in Docker) | Stores `orbitpage.db` and uploaded media. |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Recommended | Request origin | Canonical public URL used for SEO, sharing, sitemap, and QR codes. |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_NAME` | No | `OrbitPage` | Site name used in generated metadata. |
| `SEO_INDEXING` | No | `true` | Set to `false` for private or staging deployments. |
| `UPLOAD_STORAGE_QUOTA_MB` | No | `1024` | Total upload quota for the installation. |
| `VIDEO_UPLOAD_LIMIT_MB` | No | `100` | Per-file MP4/WebM upload limit. |
| `MEDIA_CLEANUP_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Automatically remove uploads no longer referenced by page data. |
| `MEDIA_CLEANUP_GRACE_HOURS` | No | `24` | Minimum age before an unused upload can be removed. |
| `RESET_TOKEN` | No | Disabled | Enables protected credential recovery. Use at least 32 characters. |
| `BASE_PATH` | No | Empty | Serves OrbitPage from a subpath such as `/links`. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | Dashboard setting | Optional environment-based key for OrbitPage AI. Administrators can instead save their key under **Dashboard > OrbitPage AI**. |
| `OPENAI_PAGE_AGENT_MODEL` | No | `gpt-5.6-terra` | Default OpenAI model when no model has been selected in the dashboard. |
| `ORBITPAGE_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | No | `JWT_SECRET` | Optional separate 32+ character secret used to encrypt the saved OpenAI key. |

See [Configuration](./docs/wiki/Configuration.md) for the complete reference, including HTTPS, reverse proxies, legal pages, and optional integrations.

### Self-hosted OrbitPage AI

Open **Dashboard > OrbitPage AI**, paste an OpenAI API key, choose a supported model, and save. The key is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before it is stored in SQLite, is never returned to the browser, and is excluded from JSON backups. A stable `JWT_SECRET` of at least 32 characters is required unless a separate `ORBITPAGE_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is configured.

The assistant receives a bounded representation of the authenticated editor's current profile, content blocks, and theme. It can only propose operations allowed by that editor's permissions. Nothing is written during generation: OrbitPage validates the structured operations, shows an exact proposal, and applies it only after explicit confirmation. Proposals expire after ten minutes and are rejected if the page changed in the meantime.

## Persistent Data and Backups

Everything that must survive a restart lives under `DATA_DIR`:

```text
orbitpage.db
uploads/
```

For Docker, persist `/app/data`. Back up both the database and uploads together, or use the JSON backup/restore controls in the Admin workspace. Export and restore can be limited to profile data, blocks, appearance, privacy, discovery files, administrator accounts, or uploaded media. Unselected restore sections are left unchanged.

Complete exports retain the historical schema-v1 format. Selective exports use schema v2 and declare their included sections explicitly; current versions accept both formats. Keep an occasional complete backup even when selective backups are convenient, and never recreate a production container without its existing volume or bind mount.

OrbitPage checks unused media automatically every six hours. The cleanup scans all page data before deleting anything and protects recent uploads for at least 24 hours by default. Administrators can preview reclaimable space or run the cleanup immediately from **Backup & Restore**. Set `MEDIA_CLEANUP_ENABLED=false` to disable the scheduled job or increase `MEDIA_CLEANUP_GRACE_HOURS` for a longer safety window.

## Deploying in Production

OrbitPage can run anywhere that supports a persistent Docker container or Node.js service, including a VM, home server, Cloud Run, Render, Fly.io, DigitalOcean, Azure App Service, Coolify, CapRover, Dokku, and similar platforms.

For a production deployment:

1. Set a stable `JWT_SECRET`.
2. Enable TOTP two-factor authentication for every privileged user under **Dashboard > Access**, then store the one-time recovery codes outside OrbitPage.
2. Persist `DATA_DIR` or `/app/data`.
3. Put the service behind HTTPS using your platform or reverse proxy.
4. Set `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the final public origin.
5. Back up the database and uploads before upgrades.
6. Check `/health` after each deployment.

Read [Deployment](./docs/wiki/Deployment.md) for reverse-proxy headers, subpath hosting, upgrades, and rollback guidance.
